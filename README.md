## Courses

### Introduction to experimental psychology

*Instructor: Elena Gorbunova*

This course will cover the basics of experimental planning and execution,
including theoretical questions, types of experimental designs and their
comparative advantages and disadvantages, experimental validity, etc. When it
comes to social sciences experimentation, a lot of difficult questions arise.
How do I formulate the hypotheses of my experimental study? How do I choose the
most appropriate design? What is the best way to define a sample? How to create
the stimuli? Should I keep my experiment as simple as possible or should I try a
complex design? We will review the aspects of experimental planning relevant for
all social sciences, with the focus on studies in psychology.

### Experiments in media and consumer studies

*Instructor: Meghan Sanders*

The course will cover a selection of specific topics, including repeated
messages experimental designs, facial expression capture and eye-tracking for
webpage perception research.

### Online experiments with examples from sociology and political science

*Instructor: Amalia Alvarez*

This course will cover the design of online experiments, specifically focusing
on the implementation of online treatments and measurement of attitudinal and
behavioral variables online. We will discuss the advantages of web-based designs
for collecting data on a large scale, as well as for implementing the
lab-in-the-field and natural experiments. The course will use examples from the
existing research, but also give students a chance to participate in a real
online experiment. Furthermore, the course will cover common problems and
limitations of online experimentations and strategies of dealing with them.
Specifically, we will talk about possible issues with data quality and
participant motivation. Best practices of online research will also be
discussed.

This course will have a section introducing students to causal inference from
experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Particularly, students will learn
how to collect the data so as to establish that the relationship in question is
causal.

### Agent-based modeling

*Instructor: Martin Lukac*

Social simulations in virtual research environments allow researchers to gain
new insights into the complex ways that societies function. In this course, we
will introduce agent-based modelling as a theory-construction tool for the
social sciences. We will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of
agent-based modelling: starting with an introduction to complex adaptive systems
and foundational agent-based models, up to more advanced simulation experiments
and calibration methods. We will focus on social phenomena such as residential
segregation, epidemiological and social contagion, and opinion polarization. We
will introduce the NetLogo programming language and learn by modifying existing
models from its library. No prior programming background is required, but
participants should be ready to see and write some code during the course.

### Eye-Movement tracking for reading research (guest lecture)

*Lecturer: Reinhold Kliegl*

The lecture will cover the basic assumptions and rationale of eye-tracking
research of reading, introduce the students to its main experimental paradigms
and the basic approaches to data collection and reduction.

### Practical training session with an eye-tracker (offline only)

*Instructor: Svetlana Alexeeva*

This workshop will consist of a series of hands-on sessions designed to help
learners incorporate eye-tracking methodologies in their research. The first
section is an introduction to eye tracking covering eye physiology, basic eye
movements and oculomotor events measured. The second section will cover
eye-tracking hardware, focusing on types of equipment and participant setup. The
third practical training session will focus on recording eye movements of
participants scanning social media webpages. The final session will cover data
export and analysis.

### Online experiments: PsychoPy & Pavlovia tutorial

*Instructor: Elena Gorbunova*

Online experimentation has enabled relatively cheap and fast data collection on
a massive scale, making familiarity with various toolkits for online experiments
an indispensable skill for researchers. This tutorial offers an overview of one
such platform, Pavlovia, which is based on the PsychoPy software package.
Students will practice building their own experiments in PsychoPy and
transferring them to Pavlovia.

### Studying social norms with behavioral experiments

*Instructor: Philipp Chapkovski*

From ‘Do we split the bills on our first date’ to ‘Should we offer a bribe to a
road police officer’ our day-to-day behavior is largely driven by social norms.
Social norms are our expectations about what others would do in a similar
situation and what they expect us to do. Even if the norms are fundamental for
understanding human behavior, studying how they appear, are maintained or die
is a hard nut to crack. Standard observational methods such as surveys are
often prone to social desirability bias and field observations are not always
feasible. In this course we show how social norms can be studied by the way of
behavioral experiments both in their statics (what kind of norms an individual
follows in a specific context), and dynamics (what factors make the norms
appear or fade out). Using the oTree platform we will learn how to design,
program and conduct some pivotal experiments on social norms.

## Travel

Due to the challenges of the global pandemic, we will be unable to provide full
support with travel, accomodation, and visa application. It is also impossible
to foresee what travel limitations will be in place in July 2021 and whether it
will be possible to issue a visa on a short notice. Usually this process
requires ten-thirteen weeks but in the present circumstances the procedure and
its duration are unpredictable. Thus, if you are unsure whether you will be able
to get a visa on time, we recommend that you participate online. We will be
happy to answer any further questions regarding the possibility of your visit
and assist to the extent possible.
